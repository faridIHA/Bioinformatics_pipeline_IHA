# Code Compilation for IHA Bioinformatics Projects

Welcome to this repository! This collection showcases the codes and scripts I have used the bioinformatics projects for IHA research. The repository consists of:

1. **README.md file for description**
2. **scripts**

## Languages Used
- **Bash**
- **R**

## Bioinformatics Pipelines

These bioinformatics analysis pipelines were developed for Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture (IHA), Texas A&M AgriLife Research, College Station, TX. The pipelines cover the following tasks:

### RNA and DNA Sequencing Analysis
- **Mapping reads**
- **Identifying differentially expressed genes**
- **Exploring alternative splicing events**

### SNP Calling
- **Identifying and characterizing genetic variations**


### Quality Control of Raw Sequencing Data
- **Assessing data integrity**
- **Filtering low-quality reads**

Scripts designed specifically for execution on the TAMU HPRC cluster are included, along with tool commands.
