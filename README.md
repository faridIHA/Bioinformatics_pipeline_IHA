# Code Compilation for Genomics and Bioinformatics Projects

Welcome to my repository! This collection showcases the codes and scripts I have used and am currently using for my genomics and bioinformatics projects during my Ph.D. and postdoctoral research. The repository is organized into three main sections:

1. **Genomics**
2. **Bioinformatics**
3. **Data Processing**

Each section contains sub-sections based on specific projects and tasks.

## Languages Used
- **Bash**
- **R**
## Genomics
Genomics analysis cover the following topics:
- **Genome-wide Association study (GWAS)**
- **Population structure analysis using STRUCTURE v2.3.4 command line version**
- **VCF files**

## Bioinformatics Pipelines

These bioinformatics analysis pipelines were developed during my postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture (IHA), Texas A&M AgriLife Research, College Station, TX. The pipelines cover the following tasks:

### RNA and DNA Sequencing Analysis
- **Mapping reads**
- **Identifying differentially expressed genes**
- **Exploring alternative splicing events**

### SNP Calling
- **Identifying and characterizing genetic variations**


### Quality Control of Raw Sequencing Data
- **Assessing data integrity**
- **Filtering low-quality reads**

Scripts designed specifically for execution on the TAMU HPRC cluster are included, along with tool commands.
